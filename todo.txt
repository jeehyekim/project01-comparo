app.js - fix required not required if there is more than one block last block is the one left blank

url field shrinks way small

thinkn through how adding last one works. if no valid url, then discount it, if something is entered in that field, then make sure it's a url (basically choices are either valid url, or completely blank and will be dropped from the submit form. -- thinking check value, and if there is a value in the field, add the class 'required',  but if there is no value to the text in the box, then basically don't include that box in the request sent.)

title -- add title next to add url. If title is left blank, will go with default page title.

client - post request.


server - app.post - req.body will be the url that i need to add

db.url.create

find page

db.page.urls.push(url)
